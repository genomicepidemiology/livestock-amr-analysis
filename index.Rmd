# Overview {-}
This website presents the R code used in the study **`r RoederLivestockAMR::study_info$title`** (Röder *et al.*, [Link](`r RoederLivestockAMR::study_info$url`)).

I tried to create a thorough documentation of the R code used
in the study and welcome you to have a look at the whole process.

That being said, if you are just looking for the code behind certain figures or tables,
here is where to find them:

* Figures
  + Figure 1
  + [Supplementary Figure S-A](#n-reads)
* Tables
  + [Table A](#n-herds)
  + Supplementary Table S-A

<!-- [Here](#intro) or \@ref(intro) for links-->
